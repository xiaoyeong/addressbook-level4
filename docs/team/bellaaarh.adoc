== PROJECT: DebtTracker

== Overview

Debt Tracker (DT) is a desktop application for users to manage their loans and debts. The user interacts with it using
a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java,
and has about 21kLoC. This application is meant for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to use, and/or personal use.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to *keep a separate list for paid transactions*
** What it does: Allows the user to conveniently keep track of transactions that have been paid off
** Justification: This feature helps the user keep a history of transactions that have been settled, which they can use
in case the other party involved in the transaction tries to confuse the user's memory, or to dispute whether a
transaction has been paid. This protects the user from possibly being scammed into making the same payment again. +
Furthermore, by giving the user a history of transactions that have been settled to refer to, they will get a clearer
understanding of how their current financial status came to be what it is.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an deep understanding of AddressBook-Level4's original code in order to be
implemented. In order to add this enhancement, I had to refactor several functions and classes and use the data
structures they implemented. +
The test code was originally from the provided DeleteCommand Tests, but has been refactored
to be for PaidCommand.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *the wildcard search feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to locate a transaction linked to a person whose first or last name contains the
substring
** Justification: Sometimes the user may not be entirely sure of how a name is spelt, or they may forget how to spell
their transaction partner's full name. With this feature, they need not remember the full name in order to find the
intended transaction.

=== Locating transactions by substring : `search`

Depending on the format you use, this command matches a set of any consecutive letters (otherwise known as substring)
you key in with the names of persons involved in either current transactions, or in past transactions. +

Conditions: +

* The substring that you key in must be within either the first or last name of a person involved only.
Otherwise, an empty list of transactions will be returned. +
* If you key in several substrings (eg. search al ice), all contacts in which the first or last names contain any of the
 substrings (in the example, the substrings are "al" and "ice") will be returned.

Format: +
To find within current transactions list: search SUBSTRING [MORE_SUBSTRINGS] ... +
To find within past transactions list: search past SUBSTRING [MORE_SUBSTRINGS] ...

e.g. search Be +
OR search Be + Am +
OR search past Le +
OR search past Yu + F + Pot

=== Marking a transaction as Paid : `paid`

This command deletes a transaction (that you deem to have been paid off) from the current transactions list,
and adds it to the past transactions list. +

Format: paid INDEX

e.g. paid 4

=== Switching between viewing past and current transactions : `switch`

Depending on your input, it will switch to either the Current Transactions tab or the Paid Transactions tab. +
This is not an undoable command, but you can use this command to go back to your original tab.

Format: switch LIST_TYPE

e.g. switch curr +
OR switch past

== Use Cases
=== Wildcard Search

MSS:

1. User requests to find a certain contact containing the substring they key in.
2. The system will filter out a list of contacts whose first names or last names contain the substring.

Extensions:

1a. User does not enter a substring after the command word.

    ... The system raises an error specifying that there must be a substring input.
    ... Use case ends.

=== Paid

MSS:

1. User requests to shift a transaction under the Current Transactions tab to the Past Transactions tab.
2. User is prompted to input the list index of the transaction to be shifted.
3. User keys in the index in the form and submits the form.
4. Selected transaction is deleted from the transactions list under the Current Transactions tab, and is stored in the
transactions list under the Past Transactions tab, in the database.

Extensions:

2a. User inputs an invalid index.

    ... The system raises an error specifying that the index entered was invalid.
    ... Use case ends.

2b. The transactions list under Past Transactions is full and cannot store any more transactions.

    ... The user is informed that the quota of transactions allocated to him/her has exceeded.
    ... The user is prompted that his oldest transaction will be removed. If user agrees, then the oldest transaction will
    be removed.
    ... If the user declines, the user is displayed his/her 5 oldest transactions and asked to clear one of them.
    ... If the user refuses to clear any of his/her transactions, the user is informed that he/she cannot enter another
    transaction without clearing any of the previous transactions.
    ... Use case ends.

== Instructions for Manual Testing
=== Paid Command
 .  Prerequisites: The index the user keyed in must have a valid transaction at that numbered entry in the transactions
 list under the Current Transactions tab.
 .. Test case: `paid 1` +
    Expected: If the transactions list under the Current Transactions tab is at least 3 entries long, the third
    transaction from that list is deleted, and added to the transactions list under the Past Transactions tab.
 .. Incorrect paid commands to try: `paid`, `paid 0`, `paid x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
    Expected: Error details (showing an invalid index was keyed in) will be displayed in the results display.
