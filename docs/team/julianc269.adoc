== PROJECT: DebtTracker

== Overview

Debt Tracker is a CLI-based desktop application that helps users manage their finances. It keeps track of the financial
transactions the user undertakes. The primary target audience of this application is Small and Medium Entreprises (SMEs) in Singapore since
they typically face budget constraints and have to maintain a good credit score. However, this application can also be used by individuals
who may want to maintain a database of their personal transactions.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *view transactions on Google Calendar*
** What it does: Allows the user to view their transactions on Google Calendar
** Justification: This feature helps the user keep track of their transaction deadlines by displaying them in a calendar in an organized manner. Users can view this calendar on their smartphones or on any device with a web browser.
** Highlights: This implementation uses the https://developers.google.com/calendar/[Google Calendar API] provided by Google. Working with the API requires reading through an extensive amount of documentation. Challenges arise when the documentation is insufficient, which I have encountered when implementing batch requests to the API.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the ability to *filter transactions by various criteria*
** What it does: Allows the user to filter transactions by various criteria such as the person/company name, the transaction amount and transaction deadline etc. A large number of filter options are provided to allow for a highly customizable search.
** Justification: As the user may have a large number of transactions, finding the relevant transaction(s) manually may be extremely time-consuming. The filter feature allows the user to easily view and focus on the transactions that are relevant to their current purpose.
