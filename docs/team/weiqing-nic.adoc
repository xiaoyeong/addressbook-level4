== PROJECT: DebtTracker

== Overview

Debt Tracker is a CLI-based desktop application that helps users manage their finances. It keeps track of the financial
transactions the user undertakes. The primary target audience of this application is Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore since
they typically face budget constraints and have to maintain a good credit score. However, this application can also be used by individuals
who may want to maintain a database of their personal transactions.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to Add and Change Photo Command
** What it does: allows the user to Add and Change Photo that is in PNG format to each transactions.
** Justification: : As debt tracker ‘s users are mainly small, medium enterprise (SME), they will have many contacts in the address book. This feature improves the product significantly because the users can identify their contacts easily.
** Highlights: The command is simple to use it updates the photo quickly. If the user types in an invalid path, it will display the default picture instead. If the user delete the uploaded photo, the display photo will still be displayed, as we make a copy of that image and save it in PhotoFolder.
