== Contributions to the User Guide

* *Analysing a loan’s possible amount: `analytics`*

Analyses the amount you have left after taking into consideration your loans, and the amount that you can loan out. A positive value returned indicates a healthy financial balance (defined to be a surplus) whereas a negative amount returned indicates a unhealthy financial balance (defined to be a deficit).

** Format: “analytics” or “analytics dd/mm/yyy”.
** Examples:
*** analytics
*** analytics 10/25/2020

* *Lists all transactions which deadline is closest: `nexttransaction`*

This command filters and lists out the transaction(s) which deadlines are closest to the current date. This informs the user which transaction is the most urgent. +
