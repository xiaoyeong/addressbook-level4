== Introduction

Debt Tracker (DT) is for those *who prefer to use a desktop app for tracking the user’s loans.*
DT has a mixed usage of *Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).*
DT can keep a record of your loans and debts as fast as other apps, if not faster!

== Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer. +
2. Download the latest link:{repoURL}/releases[debttracker.jar]. +
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for the application. +
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. +
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing help and pressing Enter +
   will open the help window.

[[Features]]
== Features

NOTE: Commands are solely for current transaction list unless specified otherwise. +

NOTE: Commands that make use of the transaction amounts such as filter, analytics and interest can be used
      properly only after the convert command is executed first +

NOTE: The command words are case-sensitive. +


=== Viewing help : `help`

Invokes the user guide for handy reference when typing commands. +

Format: `help`

=== Adding a transaction : `add`

Adds a transaction to the current transaction list in the database. +

Conditions: +

* The transaction's attributes are case sensitive.

* The transaction type can only be a loan or a debt +

  E.g. tt/loan OR tt/debt

* The transaction amount must be prefixed with a three-letter currency code (such as SGD) +
  and then with a value that is a real number rounded to two decimal places (even with a +
  trailing zero)

  E.g. ta/SGD 45.20 is valid
       ta/SGD 45.3 is not valid (Only one digit after the decimal point)
       ta/IN 56.75 is not valid (The currency code must consist of 3 letters as per ISO 3166 standard)

* The transaction deadline must be a valid date according to the Gregorian Calendar +
  following the DD/MM/YYYY format and should be a date in the future. +

  E.g. If the date of use of the application is 2nd November 2018:
       td/25/12/2018 is valid
       td/30/10/2018 is not valid (It's a date that is in the past)
       td/29/02/2018 is not valid (It's not a valid date according to the Gregorian Calendar)

* A person's name should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and should not be blank. +

* A person's phone number should consist of only digits, with a minimum of 3 digits +

* A person's email address should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
    ** The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses.
    ** This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. "
    ** The domain name must:
       *** be at least 2 characters long\n"
       *** start and end with alphanumeric characters\n"
       *** consist of alphanumeric characters, a period or a hyphen for the characters in between, if any.

* A person's address can take any values but must not be blank.

* The tags associated with a person must be alphanumeric

* If the tokens such as tt/ or ta/ are repeated several times and contain valid values, then the last value is
  considered.

* Duplicate transactions consist of same type, amount, deadline and person.
  ** A duplicate person is a person with the same name and same email or phone number as another person in the
     database.

Format:  +

add tt/TYPE ta/AMOUNT td/DEADLINE n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]… +

E.g. add tt/loan ta/SGD 50.00 td/18/12/2018 n/James Ho p/22224444 e/jamesho@example.com +

* This command can only be used with one of the following keywords: 1) show  2) login 3) logout 4) sync +
* The keywords are case-sensitive.
* This feature requires linking the deadlines to your Google account. Hence a test google account will be provided. +

Test Account: +

* The Google account provided below can be used for testing the calendar feature:

    Username: debttracker2103@gmail.com
    Password: 2103testaccount

** Note:  Use of a personal or newly created Google account is highly recommended. Usage of the provided test account may produce unexpected results, as multiple users may access the test account at the same time.

Formats: +

* To show calendar in the app: calendar show +
* To login to your Google account: calendar login +
* To logout of your Google account: calendar logout +
* To manually synchronise the user's current transactions with the calendar: calendar sync

=== Converting multiple currencies: `convert`

Converts amounts in multiple different foreign currencies to their respective amounts in +
the base currency, Singapore Dollars. +

NOTE: Makes use of an external foreign currency API: https://free.currencyconverterapi.com/[Free Currency Converter API]

Format: convert

=== Calculating interest on transactions: `interest`

Calculates interest on each transaction on a *monthly basis*, based on the interest rate and scheme provided. +

Conditions: +

* Interest scheme must be either simple or compound. These keywords are case-insensitive. +

* An interest rate must be entered in percentage with the value rounded to two decimal places. +

* The interest rate is capped at 4.00%. +

* Since interest calculation happens on a monthly basis, those transactions less than a month away from the current
  date will not accrue any interest. +


Format: interest INTEREST_SCHEME INTEREST_RATE +

e.g. interest simple 1.10%

=== Updating a transaction : `edit`

Edits an existing transaction’s details. +

Conditions: +

* An index must be provided identifying a transaction and that index must be an integer ranging from 1 to the size
  of the transaction list displayed

* Attributes such as name, phone and email are optional

* The attributes are case sensitive

* The attributes should follow the format specified in the add command.

Format:

edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]… +

E.g. edit 2 n/James Lee e/jameslee@example.com

=== Sorting transactions : `sort`

Sorts transactions based on an input or default parameter.

Conditions: +

* Valid sort parameters are:
  ** amount
  ** type
  ** deadline

* The sort parameters are case-insensitive.

* If a parameter other than the listed ones is provided or the parameter is not provided at all,
  then the application assumes that you want to sort by the default parameter, the person name
  and the tie is broken using the phone number or email address.


Format: +

sort SORT_PARAMETER +

E.g. sort type OR +
     sort amount OR +
     sort deadline +

=== Filtering transactions by various criteria: `filter`

Filters transactions matching specified criteria. +

Note: This command does not work with the `undo` and `redo` commands, since it does not modify the debt tracker's data.

Conditions: +

* At least one criteria has to be specified. +

* The same parameter cannot be specified twice (e.g. `filter n/alex n/bernice` will be rejected) +

* The following parameters correspond to the same attributes used in the add command: +

    [tt/TYPE] [ta/AMOUNT] [td/DEADLINE] [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]

** The values provided for these parameters are case-insensitive +
(i.e. `filter n/aLeX` produces the same results as `filter n/alex`)

** These parameters do not require an exact match. A match will be found as long as the respective attribute contains the sequence of characters provided. (e.g. `filter e/example.com` will match a transaction with the email `alexyeoh@example.com`)

** Multiple keywords can be specified for each attribute, separated by a semi-colon (e.g. `filter a/Jurong;Tampines;Geylang`). +
Transactions matching at least one of the keywords will be returned.

* The following parameters must match a specific format :


    [tamin/MIN_AMOUNT] [tamax/MAX_AMOUNT] [tdmin/EARLIEST_DATE] [tdmax/LATEST_DATE]

** `MIN_AMOUNT` and `MAX_AMOUNT` must be a real number rounded to two decimal places. Unlike `AMOUNT`, the currency code should be omitted (e.g. `filter tamin/10.00 tamax/50.00`). +
 The transaction amounts will be compared only by their numerical value (e.g. `filter tamin/10.00` will match both `USD 11.00` and `IDR 11.00`). +
 Use the convert command before filtering if a comparison between different currencies is desired.

** `EARLIEST_DATE` and `LATEST_DATE` must be a valid date according to the Gregorian Calendar, following the DD/MM/YYYY format

* If multiple parameters are specified, by default, only transactions satisfying the criteria for ALL parameters will be returned.

** To return transactions satisfying ANY of the parameter criteria, use the `/or` prefix.

** The `/and` prefix can also be specified for the default behavior of returning transactions satisfying ALL parameter criteria.

** The `or/` and `/and` prefixes cannot be specified at the same time.

** At least one criteria has to be specified other than the parameters `or/` and `and/`.

Format:  +

filter [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [tt/TYPE] [ta/AMOUNT] [td/DEADLINE] [tamin/MIN_AMOUNT] [tamax/MAX_AMOUNT] [tdmin/EARLIEST_DATE] [tdmax/LATEST_DATE]

Examples: +

* To filter all debts: `filter tt/debt`

* To filter all loans: `filter tt/loan`

* To filter all transactions with addresses containing 'tampines' or 'geylang':
`filter a/tampines;geylang`

* To filter all transactions with amount between 10.00 and 50.00: +

Format: nt

=== Locating transactions by substring : `search`

Depending on the format you use, this command matches a set of any consecutive letters (otherwise known as substring)
you key in with the names of persons involved in either current transactions, or in past transactions. +

Conditions: +

* The substring that you key in must be within either the first or last name of a person involved only.
Otherwise, an empty list of transactions will be returned. +
* If you key in several substrings (eg. search al ice), all contacts in which the first or last names contain any of the
 substrings (in the example, the substrings are "al" and "ice") will be returned.
