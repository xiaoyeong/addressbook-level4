* This is a desktop Debt Tracker application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is an application to help one keep track of not only their normal expenses, but also their loans (both loans they take and give).
* If managing your finances is getting too messy and complicated, leave it to this application to help you sort them out!
* Who knew managing finances could be so simple?
* While this app is aimed towards SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) for them to keep a log of their loans, this app is also available for personal use.
** The Debt Track has a more sophisticated GUI that includes a list  panel and an in-built Browser.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
